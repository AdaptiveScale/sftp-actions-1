CDAP Action plugin to copy files from the SFTP server to the specified destination.


Usage Notes
-----------
In a typical enterprise setting, it is common to have SFTP server which allows sharing of the files over network.
Various individuals and applications can upload files to the SFTP server. Consumers of these files can download
them from SFTP server for further processing. Once processed, the files on the SFTP server are no longer required
and can be deleted.

SFTP Copy plugin targets the use case where the files can be copied from SFTP server and stored on the desired
destination such as `HDFS`. If files on the SFTP server are in compressed .zip format, then plugin can optionally
un-compress them while copying.
